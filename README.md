# Project 2: Herbicide Tracker

## Description:

This app is designed to help the conventional lawn care service techinician keep track of projects/jobs. The app is important because regulators at any given time can request to see the data we caputured to verify safety regulations are kept.

Users are able to login, create new projects by filling in data inputs for typ of chemicals, amounts, surface area while a geolocator api and weather api capture the windspeed and temperature. We felt like this was the best course of action to reduce the errors assocaited with guessing temperature and or windspeed.

Once the inputs are submitted, the user can view all projects they have submitted. The app will only show each user the projects generated by thier key id, authenitcated at login.

IF there are problems with the app, or corrections to projects needed users can contact the administrators on the support page.
